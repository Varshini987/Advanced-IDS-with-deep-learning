AIM:
                      To Develop An Intrusion Detection System Leveraging Deep Learning is to improve the security of Computer Networks, detection accuracy and its enabling real time monitoring .

OBJECTIVE:
1.	Enhanced Detection Accuracy:
             Improve the accuracy of detecting intrusions by leveraging deep learning models that can identify complex patterns and subtle anomalies in network traffic and system logs.

2.	Real-Time Monitoring and Response:
              Enable real-time detection and response to security threats, minimizing the time between intrusion detection and action.

3.	Comprehensive Threat Coverage:
                Ensure the IDS can detect a wide range of threats, including known attack vectors, zero-day vulnerabilities, and insider threats.

4.	Scalability and Robustness:
                Design the IDS to scale efficiently with the growth of network traffic and data volume, maintaining performance under high loads.











METHODOLOGY:

     1.Data Collection and Preparation:
                 Identify the threats from KDD CUP.data such as the network traffic , types of attack ,description of attack severity of attack(high , medium, low) 

     2.Performance Optimization:
                               Latency Reduction: Implement techniques to  reduce inference latency, ensuring timely detection.
                                 Resource Management: Optimize the use of computational resources to handle real-time data processing efficiently.
                                 Scalability: Design the system to scale up or down based on the volume of network traffic and data.

       3.Testing and Evaluation :
                             Real-World Simulation: Deploy the IDS in a controlled environment to test its performance under real-world conditions.
                             Model Training:
•	Splitting the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.
•	Cross-validation to ensure the model's generalizability.
 4.Deployment:
                            Monitoring and Maintenance: Continuously monitor the system’s performance and conduct regular maintenance to ensure optimal operation.
              Rule and Policy Setup:
•	Defining detection rules and policies based on organizational security requirements.
•	Setting thresholds for alerts and notifications.

5.	Continuous Improvement:            
              Feedback Loop: Establish a feedback mechanism for users to report issues and suggest improvements.


 
         TOOLS:
                PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE :
                                Python language is used for detection accuracy and its enabling real time monitoring . Python is a versatile and widely-used programming language in the development of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) due to its simplicity, extensive libraries, and ease of integration.
